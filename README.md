# Pixomato Docs
This repository provides the documentation for Pixomato

This is directly integrated with the main Pixomato repository, so you can type "https://alatomking.github.io/pixomato/docs" to get this website.
Typing https://alatomking.github.io/pixomato-docs does not work, but I may create a script to be able to redirect this
